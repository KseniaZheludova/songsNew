Way back
Ooh...
Way back, yeah

I met him when I was a
Little girl, he gave me
He gave me poetry
And he was my first

But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
'Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
